# Build images

Building container images will accomplish the following tasks:

* Checkout code repositories
* Compile code
* Install operating system packages

In effect we are executing commands defined in Dockerfiles. Most services will run with a minimal image with only Java and Chipster installed on top of Ubuntu, whereas the comp (i.e. analysis) service requires a huge number of operating system
packages.

Let's check our current images:

```bash
$ sudo docker images

If you want to change something in these images, you can build your own image. For example, let's assume that you have forked [our chipster-tools](https://github.com/chipster/chipster-tools) repository to make your own changes to these scripts. 

Change the GitHub url in the buildconfig file to point to your repository. This same process would work also if you wanted to change the `Dockerfile` next to the buildconfig.

```bash
nano ../templates/builds/chipster-tools/chipster-tools.yaml
```

The current build script assumes that all source image are present locally. The easiest way to accomplish this is to build all images once. Building all images will take about half an hour. 

```bash
bash build-image.bash --all
```

Now that Docker has local copies of the source images, you can build only the image that you changed and other images that are using it as their source. By looking at the `source` sections of the buildconfigs, you can see that this `chipster-tools` image is a source of two other images: `toolbox` and `web-server`. We have to build those too.

```bash
bash build-image.bash chipster-tools
bash build-image.bash chipster-toolbox
bash build-image.bash web-server
```

Then we have to change our deployment to use these new images. In practice we only have to disable use of the default image repository for those Chipster services in our `~/values.yaml`. After this the deployment will use your own local image.

```yaml
deployments:
  toolbox:
    useDefaultImageRepo: false
  webServer:
    useDefaultImageRepo: false
```

Finally, deploy changes.

```bash
bash deploy.bash -f ~/values.yaml
```
