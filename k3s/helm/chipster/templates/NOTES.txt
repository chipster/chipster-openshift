Following user accounts were configured

USERNAME            PASSWORD
{{- range $key, $user := .Values.users }}
{{ $key }}          {{ $user.password }}
{{- end }}

Run the following command to see when all pods have started (Ctrl + C to stop):

    watch kubectl get pod

Then open the following address in a browser:

    http://{{ $.Values.host }}

{{- if $.Values.toolsBin.hostPath }}

Chipster is using the tools-bin from the host path {{ $.Values.toolsBin.hostPath }}.

{{- else if $.Values.toolsBin.version }}

A job was created to download the tools-bin package. Follow its progress:

    kubectl logs job/download-tools-bin-{{ $.Values.toolsBin.version | replace "." "-" }} -f

Restart pods when it completes.

    bash restart.bash

{{ else }}

Chipster was deployed without the tools-bin package, which includes 
tool binaries and reference data. Instructions for downloading it:
